## A fun and simple tap evolution game! What's your favorite creature?

You will help your creature evolve by clicking using JavaScript and HTML! 

Use an eventListener to track your clicks and make sure they increase by 1!

Make sure when your creature evolves a new name appears.

## Challenge Yourself

* Create at least 5 stages of growth for your creature.
* Transition between the different stages as you click the button. * One stage for 10 or more clicks.
* As your creature evolves, add some CSS using element.style
* When your creature is fully evolved, you should alert("Your creature has attained Saṃsāra.")

## Have fun!
