#### A fun and simple tap evolution game! What's your favorite creature?

You will help your creature evolve by clicking using JavaScript and HTML! 

Use an eventListener to track your clicks and make sure they increase by 1!

```evolveBtn.addEventListener("click", function evolve() {
  // add 1 to the clicks variable
  // When the number of clicks reaches 10, add a second stage of evolution to the DOM!
  // You choose the name of each additional stage.
});```

Now, first you’ll need to replace the contents of <span id="evolution"></span> with the initial stage of evolution of your creature. Each time you click the “evolve” button you will keep track of the number of clicks by adding 1 to the clicks variable. 

## Challenge Yourself

* Create at least 5 stages of growth for your creature.
* Transition between the different stages as you click the button. * One stage for 10 or more clicks.
* As your creature evolves, add some CSS using element.style
* When your creature is fully evolved, you should alert("Your creature has attained Saṃsāra.")

## Have fun!
